\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivate}
The biggest criticism of deep learning is its overt dependence on voluminous data. For human level concept learning and generalization, deep learning models need to become more data efficient. I would like to break down the task of compositionality into two parallel sub-tasks as follows:
\paragraph{Storing Information meaningfully and efficiently}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A more efficient data representation.
	\item Deducing the manifold of the data.
	\item A new RNN cell with internal bias towards composition.
	\item The new RNN cell designed with efficient memory allocation considerations.
	\item Understander Executor with a running stack.		
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Retrieving Information efficiently}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Attentive Guidance
	\item Information Compression. E.g. an entire sentence work of representation recoded into a pronoun 3 sentences later.
	\item Dynamic encoder states.
	\item Curriculum Learning.
\end{enumerate}
